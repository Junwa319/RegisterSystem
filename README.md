# RegisterSystem

> This is my first Java project to work as a medical informatics course. 

The project is to build a registration system for the hospital, allowing users to register and provide administrators with the registration records by date, doctor, department, etc.

Need to configure the environment: 
```
Java, JDBC and Mysql.
```
